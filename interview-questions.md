# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a way to impliment HTML in a JavaScript file, JSX uses camelCase for "className" instead of HTML's "class". Another syntax used in JSX is the empty fragments <></> used to enclose your components.

Researched answer: JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension) is an extension of JavaScript used in React, allowing you to impliment HTML within JavaScript. Instead of using the class attribute in HTML you would use className in JSX. For HTML an example would be <h1 class="example">Howdy!</h1> whereas in JSX you would use <h1 className="example">Howdy!</h1>

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?
